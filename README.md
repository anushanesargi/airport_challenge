Approach
---------

* I started with skimming through the complete challenge. Then written down what the challenge was all about.

* Did not exactly follow the noun, verb approach but was able to breifly write down the tasks each user story was asking us to do.

* When I started the TDD I faced a couple of issues with "simplecov" asking for ruby "3.0.2", it took me some time to figure out what was going on.

* I intially created two classes for landing and departure each but as I progressed to user story two it made more sense to have them as methods in one Airport class and use two different instances to test respective methods.

* Approaching one user story at a time really made a lot of difference to way I code.

* To my surprise I found TDD was actually the best thing to learn. I clubbed all the tests for a particular method under one "describe" and so on. Yikess, might have missed out on couple.

This is all I can think after 9 hours of problem solving.

Thank You :)
